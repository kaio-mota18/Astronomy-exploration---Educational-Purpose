### 1- About the project

This project aims to attend both native-English speakers and ESL-students that are having Astronomy-based lessons at school. It can be run on smartphones, computers or any other device that a browser runs.
  
### 2- Technologies used:
 
  + React;
  + Styled Components;
  + Nodejs.
  
### 3- Phases of the project:
  
  [‚úîÔ∏è] Creation of the structure of the pages, creation of the routes and API that will be used to create the components (planets);
  
  [‚è∞] Design the newsletter structure and turn it functional;
  
  [‚è∞] Create the logic to turn possible to interact by the Contact us page
  
### 4- Technologies that will be implemented:
  
  + Sass;
  + MongoDB;
  + PostgreSQL.
  
### 5- How to run the application:
  
  You will need to use a terminal to run it. I have used NPM and the script command will be the same I use in my machine. However, it also works with yarn.
  
  <strong>npm run start<strong/>
  
### 6 - Next updates
    
Since I was focused in developing the components and the logic to consume the API I had created, I didn't pay the proper attention about the resposive aspect of it. It's needless to say it is very important since the goal of this project is to use it in class and most of the students don't bring a laptop to classroom.
    
Another future feature will be the newsletter. Even though I pointed newsletter and contact us as different phases of the project, I believe they'll be updated almost together.
