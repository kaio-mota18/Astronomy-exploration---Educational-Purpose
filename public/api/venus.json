    "description": "Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called Earth's sister or twin planet as it is almost as large and has a similar composition. As an interior planet to Earth, Venus (like Mercury) appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun, either as morning star or evening star.",
